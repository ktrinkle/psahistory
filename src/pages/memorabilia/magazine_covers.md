This page shows covers of PSA Flighttime, PSA California, and PSA magazine.

PSA Magazine was introduced in 1969 for passengers. The publication was created by East/West Publications, who produced in-flight magazines for several other airlines after starting Flighttime. East/West (founded by a former PSA employee) published the magazine until December 1987, with the last 3 issues being simple rebadged copies of the USAir inflight magazine.

All magazine covers are courtesy of Chris Laborde. The original magazines have been donated to the collection of the CR Smith Museum.
