Here is a complete set of PSA Annual report covers. 

PSA produced annual report from 1963-1972, then as PSA, Inc. from 1973-1984. In 1985, as part of union agreements, PSA, Inc sold a percentage of the airline to the employees and made the airline publicly traded, leading to the two annual reports from 1985.

No PSA (airline) annual report was issued in 1986, due to the sale to USAir. The only annual report found is for PS Group, which is what PSA, Inc was renamed to during 1987.
