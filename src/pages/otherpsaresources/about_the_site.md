# About This Page
This site is maintained as a hobby by Kevin Trinkle. I am a native San Diegan, who remembers PSA's planes flying over the city from my youth. I started this page in 1995, to help keep PSA's memory alive. (The short and simple answer)

By day, I work for an airline in Dallas/Ft. Worth, TX. Please note that this is a personal site and the views expressed here are not those of my employer.

After over 28 years of working on this website, I'm amazed how large it is and the number of turns my life has taken since then. I didn't expect to be in Texas, at my sixth airline at this point in my life.

The first banner on this site was for the Smile High Club, which lasted from 1995 through 1998. PSA sold passes for $15 to Travel Agents, space-available. USAir ended the promotion after the full merger into the USAir system (1988.)
