The first event of "PSA Weekend 2003" was the dedication of the new Aerospace Museum exhibit. The new exhibit showcases additional pictures, old uniforms, and restores the PSA Latrine to it's rightful use.

This exhibit builds on the original 1998 display case spearheaded by the late Capt. Art Steck, with leadership from the late Capt. Randy Prine and a significant grant from the late Thomas Friedkin. Additional support came from Karen Rohr, who graciously donated her uniform collection.

Some photos from the dedication ceremony (where over 600 people were in attendance) are included here.
