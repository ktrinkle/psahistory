On March 30, 2006, US Airways threw a dedication party for the PSA Throwback airplane. The aircraft, ship 742 (re-registered N742PS to match the paint scheme) was the first of the US Airways "Throwback" airplanes to be dedicated.

N742PS was repainted to standard American Airlines colors in 2023. The current PSA retrojet is N580UW, an Airbus A321-232.
