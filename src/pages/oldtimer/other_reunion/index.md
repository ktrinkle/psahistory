# PSA Oldtimers

## 26th annual PSA Party - September 2024
## PSA Reservations Reunion - October 2024


Our name and affiliations may have changed through the years but there will always be our original and special "PSA Oldtimer family". Join us and tell all our PSA friends too, about this tradition of ours.


Who is a "PSA Oldtimer?", a "youngster" now disguised with greying hair, attractive wrinkles and various aches and pains who can remember what they did for and with Pacific Southwest Airlines in the good old days. An "Oldtimer" is one that is attracted to re-unions, friends, happy productive times and who still has good memories about working tor the greatest airline that flew with its own smile, that is still indelibly written into so many hearts and into the pages of Aviation History.


As times have changed over the years, additional venues of communication have been made available. For those on Facebook, there are two Facebook groups devoted to PSA employees - [Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/47162793603/) and [PSA - Pacific Southwest Airlines](https://www.facebook.com/groups/59126863553/). Both sites are generally more up to date than I can keep this site.


To navigate between the various sections of the Oldtimers site, use the menu marked "Oldtimers" at the top of your screen.


THANK YOU FOR VISITING US. Please be sure to enjoy the pictures of our past reunions from the menu up top.
