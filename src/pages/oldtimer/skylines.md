Skylines was PSA's employee newsletter, conceived by Jean Friedkin in 1953 as a way of communicating among the far-flung PSA family. (Before 1950, all PSA/Friedkin Aeronautics employees were concentrated in San Diego). Employees contributed stories from each department, and some wild humor came out of the newsletter.

Skylines was discontinued in 1969 with the introduction of PSA Flighttime, the PSA in-flight magazine. It was reintroduced in June 1976, and the employee section of PSA California magazine was discontinued.

Included here are full-text digital copies of Skylines. They tell much of the PSA story in the employees' own words, and can do it better than I can.
