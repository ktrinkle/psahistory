# PSA Party

## 26th annual PSA Party - September 2024

Begun as Ted Fritzges' retirement party, the PSA Party continues to offer the PSA family a chance to get together, dance, and party. 

The 2024 party may have some changes. With dwindling crowds, efforts are happening to determine the future of the party, whether it includes price increases, a change of date, or a change of venue. Stay tuned for more information.

Photos of past parties (from 1999 forward) are available here, with limited exceptions for the years that I have not been able to attend.
