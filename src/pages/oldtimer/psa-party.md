# PSA Party

## 27th annual PSA Party - September 25, 2025

Begun as Ted Fritzges' retirement party, the PSA Party continues to offer the PSA family a chance to get together, dance, and party. 

5-10 PM at the Bali Hai Club. Hawaiian Buffet and No Host Full Bar available. Cocktail party attire. 

$50 per person cash at the door.

Photos of past parties (from 1999 through 2023) are available here, with limited exceptions for the years that I have not been able to attend.
