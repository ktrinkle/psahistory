<p><strong>While it is not the policy of the webmaster to operate a page devoted to tragedies, they are an integral part of the PSA story. As the focus on this site are positive memories of PSA, this page focuses on the memory of those PSA family members lost in the two incidents.</strong></p>

<p>September 25, 1978. A gloriously clear Santa Ana day in San Diego. PSA Flight 182 originated in Sacramento, making an intermediate stop in Los Angeles, before flying the short leg back home to San Diego. 128 passengers were aboard, along with the seven operating crewmembers.</p>

<p>On approach to San Diego, N533PS was flying a visual approach to Runway 27. At the same time, student pilot David Lee Boswell and instructor Martin Kazy were doing ILS approaches to Runway 9, terminating in a missed approach. ATC directed him to climb away from the field at a heading of 070. At 3200 feet on descent, PS182 spotted the Cessna while climbing out of 1700' (at 09:00:21 local time.) The Cessna, still climbing, started to veer to course 090 (the same as PSA 182.) Both aircraft were told to maintain visual separation. The 727 overtook the Cessna, while descending, and the Cessna climbed right into the 727 right wing (not visible from the cockpit) at 09:01:47 local time, at an altitude of 2600 feet. The 727 was monitoring SAN tower, while the Cessna was on San Diego approach. (Paraphrased from Macarthur Job's book, Air Disaster Volume II, and the NTSB report.)</p>

<p>Hans Wendt was covering the opening of a service station in North Park, and looked up to see the following view, which he caught on film:</p>

<p>The ensuing explosion and fire sent a billowing cloud of smoke visible throughout the county. PSA and emergency personnel rushed to the scene, but little could be done. As news reports filtered out, employees began calling one another, trying to find out who was on the doomed flight. Everyone at PSA knew someone on that airplane, and San Diego and PSA grew up together. The sense of loss and devastation was enormous, as well as disbelief. San Diego came together that hot, fateful day in mourning for the loss.</p>

<p>Many of the passengers were PSA employees deadheading or commuting to the San Diego headquarters/base. For those who lost their friends in this tragedy, it struck even harder.</p>

<p>In 1982, Capt. Robert Chapman blamed the crash on pilot fatigue, setting off the media and causing PSA officials to deny the allegation.</p>

<p>For more memories from people involved, San Diego Magazine's August 1998 issue has information, or various stories can be found with the San Diego Union-Tribune.</p>

<p>In 1998, a plaque was placed at the North Park library, close to the site of the crash. A tree was also planted in memory of the victims.</p>

<p>Every September 25, people gather to remember Flight 182 at the corner of Dwight and Nile in San Diego.</p>

<p>In 1987, PSA Flight 1771 crashed near Harmony, CA. N168US (350PS) plummeted into the ground from 22,000 feet, causing the plane to go supersonic and break up enroute. The flight data recorder was severely damaged, and the Cockpit Voice Recorder was damaged, albeit recoverable.</p>

<p>David Burke was a USAir employee. He was called in to talk with his supervisor about missing liquor money, and terminated. However, his badge was not taken from him. On the way out of LAX, he bought a ticket for flight 1771 the next day.</p>

<p>On December 7, flight 1771 departed with Burke and his ex-supervisor aboard. Burke smuggled a gun on the plane by using his badge to bypass security. On climbout, he got up, dropped a note in his ex-supervisor's lap, then came back and shot the gun. He then went up to the cockpit, shot the flight crew, and used the final bullet on himself. (The badge was found in the wreckage).</p>

<p>The following employees lost their lives in the crash. (Photos courtesy of Chris Laborde)</p>
