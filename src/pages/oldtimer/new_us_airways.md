<p>On August 23, 2005, US Airways and America West unveiled the new color scheme for the merged airline. In a five city tour encompassing all three then-US Airways hubs (Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Charlotte) and both then-America West hubs (Las Vegas and Phoenix), aircraft N109UW flew around the country with several employees in their previous carrier's uniforms.</p>

<p>The PSA Oldtimers Page went to the event in Charlotte. Two former PSA employees were wearing their old uniforms, joining employees in America West, Allegheny, and Piedmont uniforms.</p>

<p>Also unveiled were artwork depicting the four "heritage" special schemes. As Doug Parker noted in his speech, "As we looked back at the history of US Airways we found employees that were very loyal to their original airlines." Four schemes are painted - America West, Allegheny, Piedmont, and of course...PSA. With smile.</p>
