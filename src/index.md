PSA - Pacific Southwest Airlines - was more than just an airline. It was a family. An innovator, who's success was one of the primary motivations to deregulate the airline industry in 1978. A leader in the industry. An integral part of the Golden State, a way of life for residents as well as employees. Best known for smiles on the airplanes and stewardesses in hot pants, PSA graced California's skies for 39 years before being merged into USAir.

This page is devoted to those who's lives were touched by PSA - employees, travelers, and airplane enthusiasts.

As times have changed, much of the reason for this site no longer exists. Going forward, the focus will primarily be on former employees and the reunions, and as such, most of the memorabilia has been removed.
